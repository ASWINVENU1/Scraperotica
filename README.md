# Scraperotica
A literotica scraper, something I did since I was feeling bored and wanted to learn beautifulsoup - use at your own risk.
Relies heavily on hard coded tags which may need to be changed soon.

# Usage
python ./scraperotica.py < story link or the author uid >

author id example,uid=5375485 in https://www.literotica.com/stories/memberpage.php?uid=5375485&page=submissions
